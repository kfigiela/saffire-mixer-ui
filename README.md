A mixer GUI for [Focusrite Saffire LE](http://web.archive.org/web/20071011003332/http://www.focusrite.com/product/saffire_le/) audio interface for macOS Catalina & Big Sur that still support FireWire audio, but the original SaffireControl LE is no longer usable as it is 32-bit app. It also works on M1-based macs with Rosetta2.
